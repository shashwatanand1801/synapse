# Synapse

Synapse is an AI-powered project within the Beckn framework, leveraging GPT-3.5 and cutting-edge language models to create a versatile adaptor for platforms aiming to implement the Beckn protocol. This innovative solution employs AI prompts to extract essential nouns and verbs from real-world business use cases and maps them to the standardized Beckn protocol schema. Additionally, it features a JSON transformation schema for seamless conversion, an AI-driven algorithm for mapping Beckn protocol APIs to proprietary APIs and vice versa, and a SaaS service that generates Beckn protocol compliant JSONs for diverse use cases. Synapse essentially serves as a bridge, enabling effortless integration of proprietary APIs with the Beckn protocol through advanced AI capabilities.

## Why Synapse?

To simplify and accelerate the integration of diverse business systems with the Beckn protocol, fostering decentralized interactions and standardized communication.


## Features

- A JSON transformation schema that maps nouns and verbs from real-world use cases to beckn protocol schema and actions.
- An AI-enabled algorithm to map beckn protocol APIs to proprietary APIs and vice-versa.
- Storing the Mapping in a MongoDB database.
- A React UI for interacting with the Mapping system.
